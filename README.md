#Manage a small inventory of fertilizer products.

Use Ruby on Rails to develop a small app that will allow me to track inventory of ferilizer products.  Manage my sales contacts associated with these products and track sales and commissions.  Also send a sales reciept to the client and also a confirmation of sale to the corporate headquaters.  EVentually I would like to maintain electronic product information, bulletins, msds and labels for the inventory.  

##Future features

* Automate and display soil and water analysis
* Create printed media and hypermedia displays formats for these analysis
* Give customers the ability to view trends in their soil / water fertility requirements
* Develop a small product information website to present the company and its products and services.  
* Develop a CMS system to allow for easy addition and deletion of products and their information. 
* Create a blog to announce company news and technical articles.
* Develop a sorting application that can produce fertility protocols based on soil and water analysis.
* Create an fertility / Chemical application record keeping system to log applications.
